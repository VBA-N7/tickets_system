Those scripts allow you to simulate a queue system that can be used in a class. 
I was bored to raise my hand in class and waiting for the teacher to come and help me.

Client has to know IP address of the server and his port. 
Server is using IP address that DHCP server gave him. 
By default, server is listening to the port n°5000. It is possible to change it in *server.py*. 

If client want to disconnect from server, it needs to send *'exit'* as a message.
